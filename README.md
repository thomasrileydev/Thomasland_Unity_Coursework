# Thomasland_Unity_Coursework
This game must be in the public domain because of the licences used.
This is an A-level project.
This game uses public domain licences which I do not own.
Please report any issues and I will try my best to fix them.
The project was created in Unity 2017.1.2f1 (64-bit) and is designed be compiled for PC, Mac and Linux standalone. It might work for other targets but your mileage may vary.
